# Hoshi Android Current Architecture

Date: 2026-06-25

This document describes the current architecture that exists in the Android
repo. It is not a future plan and should not track task status. Long-lived
refactor goals belong in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md`.

## App Shape

- The app is a single Android application module under `app`.
- UI is Jetpack Compose + Material 3.
- Navigation uses Navigation3 typed route keys, `AppShell`, and `NavDisplay`.
  Top-level Books, Dictionary, and Settings tabs each own an independent Nav3
  back stack with its own saveable entry state and per-entry ViewModel stores.
- Production dependency injection is Hilt-backed. `HoshiApplication` owns the
  app component through `@HiltAndroidApp`, and Android entry points receive
  dependencies from the Hilt graph.
- Compose still receives a Hilt-created `HoshiUiDependencies` through
  `LocalHoshiUiDependencies` as a lazy temporary bridge for app-wide
  dependencies that have not yet moved behind screen ViewModels. The bridge
  does not build the object graph manually and resolves each dependency from
  Hilt only when the current UI path reads it.
- Many screens use Hilt-backed ViewModels with immutable UI state exposed through
  `StateFlow`.
- Settings and small persisted preferences are stored behind DataStore-backed
  repositories.
- Profiles are Hilt-backed app-wide state. `ProfileRepository` stores profile
  metadata under app-specific files, exposes active profile state through
  `StateFlow`, and controls the effective content language for Reader,
  Dictionary search, Process Text lookup, Anki settings, and dictionary lookup
  sessions. Profile metadata mutations are main-safe suspend APIs backed by the
  injected IO dispatcher. Creating a profile copies existing profile-owned files
  from the current global active profile.

## Storage And Data

- Book storage is rooted in app-specific files and remains compatible with the
  iOS sidecar JSON layout.
- EPUB import enters through Android Storage Access Framework and copies content
  into app-specific storage.
- Current book folders store the packed EPUB as `<folder>/<folder>.epub` and
  persist the filename in `BookMetadata.epub`. Sidecar JSON and cached covers
  remain beside the EPUB; parser and reader paths extract packed EPUBs only into
  controlled app cache/temp directories when they need the EPUB tree.
- Book metadata, bookmarks, highlights, reading statistics, and Sasayaki data
  are persisted through book sidecar repositories and models.
- Book metadata sidecars may include a forced profile id and parsed EPUB
  language. Reader opening resolves the effective profile from forced profile,
  then EPUB language primary profile, then the global active profile.
- Dictionary import, lookup, media, style extraction, and deinflection behavior
  are owned by `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge`.
- `DictionaryLookupQueryService` owns the active native lookup session. Rebuilds
  construct a new native query session for the active profile's dictionary
  language before swapping it into service; lookup, style, and dictionary-media
  reads use the currently published session and return empty results when no
  session is ready.
- Dictionary data directories remain global under `Dictionaries/`, while each
  profile owns `dictionary_config.json` and `dictionary_settings.json` under
  `Profiles/<profileId>/`.
- Dictionary `.hoshi` backups keep the legacy root archive shape for iOS/older
  Android compatibility and include profile-scoped dictionary metadata under the
  reserved `.hoshi-profiles/` payload. The root `config.json` projects the
  default Japanese profile for single-profile restore targets; newer Android
  restores merge the profile index and profile dictionary config/settings while
  preserving profile-owned Anki and Reader settings that are outside the
  dictionary payload.
- Reader Appearance settings are stored per active/effective profile in
  `Profiles/<profileId>/reader_settings.json`; Reader Behavior and statistics
  sync settings remain global DataStore settings.
- Profile-scoped Reader Appearance, Dictionary, and Anki settings JSON reads and
  writes use injected IO dispatchers and repository-owned serialization locks.
- Frequency and pitch dictionaries are type-specific and are not treated as term
  fallback dictionaries.
- Dictionary storage/config mutations share a Hilt singleton mutation
  coordinator. Dictionary UI, manual updates, imports, and WorkManager automatic
  updates observe the same in-process busy/progress state and completed-change
  version; operational dictionary settings such as update interval, last update,
  and low-memory import remain in DataStore.

## Reader

- Reader rendering and lookup remain WebView-based to preserve iOS-aligned
  visible behavior.
- Reader layout modes are WebView-backed assets for paginated, continuous, and
  VN reading. Kotlin selects the asset, injects typed settings, and keeps
  persisted progress as chapter progress mapped to whole-book character count.
- Reader text semantics live in `reader-text-semantics.js` and are consumed by
  paginated, continuous, and VN assets for normalization, matchable character
  counting, raw character counting, and matchable-character checks.
- Paginated and continuous share live DOM ruby/text normalization through
  `reader-dom-text.js`; the mode assets keep thin public wrapper methods so
  existing reader commands and tests continue to call the same surface.
- Reader image setup semantics live in `reader-media-semantics.js` and are
  consumed by paginated, continuous, and VN assets for SVG image aspect-ratio
  correction, large image block marking, blur wrappers, native image tap
  bridging, and scoped setup. Paginated and continuous apply it to the chapter
  document and wait for image load/failure before restore; VN applies it to the
  current rendered screen without blocking screen rendering on image load.
- VN reading uses VN-specific reader-web runtime primitives for chapter content
  streams and rendered range mapping. `reader-vn-content-stream.js` owns source
  text/raw offsets, matchable offsets, ruby-aware text entries, structural IDs,
  and standalone media units. `reader-vn-range-map.js` maps VN rendered screens
  back to raw highlight ranges and matchable Sasayaki ranges. VN keeps its
  mode-specific block/sentence boundaries, reveal behavior, cross-screen
  Sasayaki merge, viewport fitting, and current-screen rendering.
- Paginated and continuous production page/scroll runtime paths remain
  unchanged and are not wired to VN content stream instances or the VN range-map
  module.
- Reader fixes compare against the iOS `ReaderWebView` and matching JS/CSS
  before adding Android-specific behavior.
- Reader resource loading must stay on the repository's safe loading path and
  must not broaden file URL access.
- Durable reader JavaScript and CSS live under
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web`; Kotlin owns typed commands, escaped
  parameters, asset loading, dynamic configuration fill-in, and WebView bridge
  invocation.
- Reader and lookup popup text selection use shared selection plumbing. Language
  utilities live in language-named assets such as `language-ja.js`, while
  selection scan policies live in `selection-ja.js` and `selection-en.js`;
  Kotlin loads the utility plus policy selected from `ContentLanguageProfile`,
  and the Japanese policy owns `scanNonJapaneseText` filtering.
- Reader, Dictionary search, and Process Text lookup popups render through the
  shared `reader-popup-host.js` iframe stack and `ReaderLookupPopupWebBridge`.
  Kotlin owns popup payloads, resource handling, and native service bridges for
  audio, dictionary media, Anki, and external links; do not reintroduce Android
  native overlay popup fallback paths for these flows.
- Lookup opens from a single tap on reader text. Long press is reserved for
  native selection/highlight flows.

## Integrations

- Anki work stays behind the Anki backend/repository boundary.
- Anki settings are stored per active profile in
  `Profiles/<profileId>/anki_config.json`; duplicate checks and note creation
  still go through the existing Anki backend/repository boundary.
- Google Drive sync uses Android/Google OAuth and Drive APIs through the
  repository/sync boundary. The Drive data source owns paginated folder listing,
  grouped sync-file discovery, bookdata upload/download, trash, cache clearing,
  and network preflight; Books keeps remote-only Google Drive books as
  `RemoteBookEntry` models rather than local `BookEntry` placeholders.
- Audio playback uses Media3/ExoPlayer with controller/repository boundaries.
- Sasayaki audiobook playback is owned by a Hilt-backed Media3
  `MediaSessionService`. The service `onCreate` lifecycle creates the active
  ExoPlayer and MediaSession, but Reader load paths do not connect to the
  service or restore media into the player. The first explicit audio control
  request connects to the `MediaSessionService`, restores the active audio
  source into the service player, and then runs the requested command so Reader
  restoration cannot leave a paused system media notification. The service
  runtime owns the active Sasayaki playback controller and active book id.
  Reader UI attaches/detaches
  cue sinks and sends explicit stop on reader exit; Android media controls and
  notification return actions route through the same service-owned session.
  Until Reader UI is fully MediaController-based, the runtime keeps one
  process-local controller connection after entering the MediaSessionService
  lifecycle, uses Sasayaki's foreground playback request state to distinguish
  user-paused task removal from ongoing background playback, clears the active
  service player before stopping paused playback on task removal, and otherwise
  follows Media3's ongoing-playback service semantics. Playback persistence
  uses the application scope with the
  injected IO dispatcher rather than Reader's Compose scope, and saves are
  serialized with latest-snapshot conflation.
  Background playback uses Android's `mediaPlayback` foreground-service path
  inside the Media3 `MediaSessionService`; Media3 owns foreground-service
  start/stop and Sasayaki does not call `startForegroundService()`,
  `startForeground()`, `stopForeground()`, `stopSelf()`, or `stopService()`
  directly for this lifecycle. Sasayaki customizes notification rendering
  through a Media3 `MediaNotification.Provider` using the service MediaSession
  token and Media3 player-command PendingIntents for transport controls, and
  the ExoPlayer uses local wake mode for long-running playback. Explicit
  Reader exit requests stop playback and clear the service player so a stopped
  session or notification cannot outlive the user-visible Reader playback
  session.
  If Android reports `ActivityManager.isBackgroundRestricted()` for the app,
  the platform treats background work as user-restricted; this can prevent
  media foreground-service startup after the Reader activity leaves the
  foreground, so the app must treat long-running background playback in that
  state as a device/user restriction rather than an in-process lifecycle
  guarantee.
- Update checks use WorkManager unique work, with worker dependencies supplied
  by Hilt's WorkManager integration.

## Native And Rust Build

The Android app currently has two native stacks:

- `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` builds the hoshidicts JNI bridge from the
  `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` submodule.
- `app/src/main/rust/hoshiepub` builds the Rust EPUB parser through UniFFI.

Current build wiring lives in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

- Registers generated UniFFI Kotlin output under
  `build/generated/source/uniffi/main/kotlin`.
- Registers generated Rust JNI libraries under debug and release `jniLibs`
  directories.
- Builds the Rust host library for JVM tests and UniFFI Kotlin generation.
- Runs UniFFI bindgen from the host Rust build.
- Builds Android Rust libraries with `cargo-ndk` for debug and release ABIs.
- Wires generated sources into Kotlin compilation and Rust host libraries into
  JVM tests.
- Uses JNA AAR for Android packaging and JNA jar for JVM unit tests.
- Uses Java 17 targets and KSP-backed Hilt code generation for the app graph.

Hard constraints:

- `app/src/main/rust/hoshiepub/uniffi.toml` must keep
  `[bindings.kotlin] android = true`.
- `cargo-ndk` should build library targets only and must not cross-compile
  UniFFI bindgen or other host binaries.

## Validation

Durable validation commands, emulator data-safety rules, test data, and manual
QA matrices live in `docs/VALIDATION.md`.
