# Hoshi Android Current Architecture

Date: 2026-06-12

This document describes the current architecture that exists in the Android
repo. It is not a future plan and should not track task status. Long-lived
refactor goals belong in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md`.

## App Shape

- The app is a single Android application module under `app`.
- UI is Jetpack Compose + Material 3.
- Navigation uses Navigation3 typed route keys, `AppShell`, and `NavDisplay`.
  Top-level Books, Dictionary, and Settings tabs each own an independent Nav3
  back stack with its own saveable entry state and per-entry ViewModel stores.
- Production dependency injection is Hilt-backed. `HoshiApplication` owns the
  app component through `@HiltAndroidApp`, and Android entry points receive
  dependencies from the Hilt graph.
- Compose still receives a Hilt-created `HoshiUiDependencies` through
  `LocalHoshiUiDependencies` as a lazy temporary bridge for app-wide
  dependencies that have not yet moved behind screen ViewModels. The bridge
  does not build the object graph manually and resolves each dependency from
  Hilt only when the current UI path reads it.
- Many screens use Hilt-backed ViewModels with immutable UI state exposed through
  `StateFlow`.
- Settings and small persisted preferences are stored behind DataStore-backed
  repositories.
- Profiles are Hilt-backed app-wide state. `ProfileRepository` stores profile
  metadata under app-specific files, exposes active profile state through
  `StateFlow`, and controls the effective content language for Reader,
  Dictionary search, Process Text lookup, Anki settings, and dictionary lookup
  sessions. Profile metadata mutations are main-safe suspend APIs backed by the
  injected IO dispatcher. Creating a profile copies existing profile-owned files
  from the current global active profile.

## Storage And Data

- Book storage is rooted in app-specific files and remains compatible with the
  iOS sidecar JSON layout.
- EPUB import enters through Android Storage Access Framework and copies content
  into app-specific storage.
- Current book folders store the packed EPUB as `<folder>/<folder>.epub` and
  persist the filename in `BookMetadata.epub`. Sidecar JSON and cached covers
  remain beside the EPUB; parser and reader paths extract packed EPUBs only into
  controlled app cache/temp directories when they need the EPUB tree.
- Book metadata, bookmarks, highlights, reading statistics, and Sasayaki data
  are persisted through book sidecar repositories and models.
- Book metadata sidecars may include a forced profile id and parsed EPUB
  language. Reader opening resolves the effective profile from forced profile,
  then EPUB language primary profile, then the global active profile.
- Dictionary import, lookup, media, style extraction, and deinflection behavior
  are owned by `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge`.
- `DictionaryLookupQueryService` owns the active native lookup session. Rebuilds
  construct a new native query session for the active profile's dictionary
  language before swapping it into service; lookup, style, and dictionary-media
  reads use the currently published session and return empty results when no
  session is ready.
- Dictionary data directories remain global under `Dictionaries/`, while each
  profile owns `dictionary_config.json` and `dictionary_settings.json` under
  `Profiles/<profileId>/`.
- Dictionary `.hoshi` backups keep the legacy root archive shape for iOS/older
  Android compatibility and include profile-scoped dictionary metadata under the
  reserved `.hoshi-profiles/` payload. The root `config.json` projects the
  default Japanese profile for single-profile restore targets; newer Android
  restores recover the full profile index plus profile dictionary
  config/settings.
- Reader Appearance settings are stored per active/effective profile in
  `Profiles/<profileId>/reader_settings.json`; Reader Behavior and statistics
  sync settings remain global DataStore settings.
- Profile-scoped Reader Appearance, Dictionary, and Anki settings JSON reads and
  writes use injected IO dispatchers and repository-owned serialization locks.
- Frequency and pitch dictionaries are type-specific and are not treated as term
  fallback dictionaries.
- Dictionary storage/config mutations share a Hilt singleton mutation
  coordinator. Dictionary UI, manual updates, imports, and WorkManager automatic
  updates observe the same in-process busy/progress state and completed-change
  version; operational dictionary settings such as update interval, last update,
  and low-memory import remain in DataStore.

## Reader

- Reader rendering and lookup remain WebView-based to preserve iOS-aligned
  visible behavior.
- Reader fixes compare against the iOS `ReaderWebView` and matching JS/CSS
  before adding Android-specific behavior.
- Reader resource loading must stay on the repository's safe loading path and
  must not broaden file URL access.
- Durable reader JavaScript and CSS live under
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web`; Kotlin owns typed commands, escaped
  parameters, asset loading, dynamic configuration fill-in, and WebView bridge
  invocation.
- Reader and lookup popup text selection use shared selection plumbing. Language
  utilities live in language-named assets such as `language-ja.js`, while
  selection scan policies live in `selection-ja.js` and `selection-en.js`;
  Kotlin loads the utility plus policy selected from `ContentLanguageProfile`,
  and the Japanese policy owns `scanNonJapaneseText` filtering.
- Reader, Dictionary search, and Process Text lookup popups render through the
  shared `reader-popup-host.js` iframe stack and `ReaderLookupPopupWebBridge`.
  Kotlin owns popup payloads, resource handling, and native service bridges for
  audio, dictionary media, Anki, and external links; do not reintroduce Android
  native overlay popup fallback paths for these flows.
- Lookup opens from a single tap on reader text. Long press is reserved for
  native selection/highlight flows.

## Integrations

- Anki work stays behind the Anki backend/repository boundary.
- Anki settings are stored per active profile in
  `Profiles/<profileId>/anki_config.json`; duplicate checks and note creation
  still go through the existing Anki backend/repository boundary.
- Google Drive sync uses Android/Google OAuth and Drive APIs through the
  repository/sync boundary. The Drive data source owns paginated folder listing,
  grouped sync-file discovery, bookdata upload/download, trash, cache clearing,
  and network preflight; Books keeps remote-only Google Drive books as
  `RemoteBookEntry` models rather than local `BookEntry` placeholders.
- Audio and Sasayaki playback use Media3/ExoPlayer with controller/repository
  boundaries.
- Update checks use WorkManager unique work, with worker dependencies supplied
  by Hilt's WorkManager integration.

## Native And Rust Build

The Android app currently has two native stacks:

- `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` builds the hoshidicts JNI bridge from the
  `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` submodule.
- `app/src/main/rust/hoshiepub` builds the Rust EPUB parser through UniFFI.

Current build wiring lives in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

- Registers generated UniFFI Kotlin output under
  `build/generated/source/uniffi/main/kotlin`.
- Registers generated Rust JNI libraries under debug and release `jniLibs`
  directories.
- Builds the Rust host library for JVM tests and UniFFI Kotlin generation.
- Runs UniFFI bindgen from the host Rust build.
- Builds Android Rust libraries with `cargo-ndk` for debug and release ABIs.
- Wires generated sources into Kotlin compilation and Rust host libraries into
  JVM tests.
- Uses JNA AAR for Android packaging and JNA jar for JVM unit tests.
- Uses Java 17 targets and KSP-backed Hilt code generation for the app graph.

Hard constraints:

- `app/src/main/rust/hoshiepub/uniffi.toml` must keep
  `[bindings.kotlin] android = true`.
- `cargo-ndk` should build library targets only and must not cross-compile
  UniFFI bindgen or other host binaries.

## Validation

Durable validation commands, emulator data-safety rules, test data, and manual
QA matrices live in `docs/VALIDATION.md`.
