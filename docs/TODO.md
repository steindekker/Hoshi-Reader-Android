# Hoshi Android Agent TODO

Last updated: 2026-05-06

This file is the short operational handoff for future agents.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file under 150 lines.
- Record only current state, next actionable work, active blockers, and durable validation requirements.
- Do not paste long emulator transcripts, adb details, screenshot observations, release notes, or per-commit history here.
- Put user-visible shipped changes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep architecture-refactor slice state out of tracked docs; use the local `.codex/skills/hoshi-refactoring-workflow` skill when available.
- Put detailed reproduction, verification logs, and investigation notes in the relevant issue, PR, commit message, or a focused doc.
- When completing a task, update the smallest relevant line here in the same commit.

## Active Work

### Architecture Refactoring

Source of truth: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md` for direction; local `.codex/skills/hoshi-refactoring-workflow` for execution workflow when available.

Status: `in_progress`

- Completed architecture slices: book repository/data-source APIs are main-safe, Sasayaki sidecar DTOs live outside feature playback/UI packages, and Reader selection bridge payload handling is extracted behind behavior tests.
- Next architecture slice: make Compose screen Flow collection lifecycle-aware with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
- Defer modularization until sidecar/model, Reader bridge/state, and native build boundaries are stable.
- Keep refactor commits slice-sized and follow the local refactoring workflow skill if present.

### Bookshelf

Status: `in_progress`

- Align multi-select, shelves, and batch actions with iOS.
- Keep EPUB import through Android SAF.
- Preserve iOS-shaped `Books/<safeTitle>` storage and sidecar JSON compatibility.

### Reader And Lookup

Status: `in_progress`

- Continuous scroll mode is implemented behind Appearance -> Layout -> Mode; keep paginated and continuous reader validation in scope for future reader changes, including forward chapter-boundary landings at the chapter start, Android visual-state-gated chapter jumps, and stable progress counters during rapid boundary flips.
- Wire remaining iOS `PopupWebView` Anki mining behavior beyond selected popup text export.
- Re-run diagonal popup swipe validation when a reliable Reader or nested Dictionary popup state is available.
- Reader fixes must start from `reference/Hoshi-Reader-iOS/Features/Reader/ReaderWebView/ReaderWebView.swift` plus the matching JS/CSS.
- Keep WebView-based reading and lookup. Do not replace it with native text rendering.
- Manual reader validation must cover cover image pages, multi-image illustration pages, long text paging, forward/backward chapter boundaries, reverse cross-chapter landing, lookup popup open, and bookmark restore.

### Dictionary

Status: `in_progress`

- Dictionary management now uses explicit drag handles and two-step swipe-to-delete to reduce accidental deletes.
- Dictionary popup entry colors now follow Hoshi's active app theme instead of Android's system night mode.
- Align recommended dictionary download/update state with iOS `DictionaryView`.
- Do not reimplement Yomitan import, lookup, media, or style extraction outside `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` unless the bridge gap is documented first.
- Frequency and pitch dictionaries must stay type-specific; do not treat metadata dictionaries as term fallback dictionaries.

### Highlights And Notes

Status: `todo`

- Store highlight anchors from WebView range data.
- Restore highlights after chapter load through JS.
- Align highlight tap, delete, and color behavior with iOS.

### Anki

Status: `in_progress`

- Android now targets AnkiDroid's native API instead of AnkiMobile callbacks.
- Current unit coverage tracks Anki settings field rows, the tags editor sharing the same focused text editing path without handlebar choices, Fetch preserving still-available deck/model selections, blank/non-Lapis -> Lapis applying defaults, and Lapis -> Lapis Fetch/mining not refilling edited mappings.
- Current emulator/device validation covers Lapis field mapping restore, field mapping list scrolling, dictionary-specific Anki handlebars without first-glossary fallback, MK3 SVG dictionary media/inline gaiji styling, selected sentence occurrence bolding, Sasayaki sentence-expanded cue audio mining, and local audio source mining.
- Next: expand duplicate and future AnkiConnect backend coverage.
- Keep AnkiConnect behind the Anki backend boundary; do not add it by coupling popup mining directly to HTTP calls.

### Audio And Sasayaki

Status: `in_progress`

- Read dictionary media through the existing dictionary bridge.
- Keep Sasayaki sidecars iOS-compatible.
- Sasayaki audiobook playback and dictionary word audio now use Media3 ExoPlayer; keep standard Android media previous/next controls, paused Sasayaki cue reveal, lookup audio, and Anki cue export behavior-protected.

### Sync

Status: `todo`

- Investigate Android Google Sign-In/OAuth/Drive API integration.
- Match iOS upstream behavior by creating the root `ttu-reader-data` Drive folder when needed.
- Sync sidecar JSON, progress, settings, and dictionary configuration.
- Do not reuse iOS token/keychain assumptions.

### Regression Coverage And Release Hardening

Status: `todo`

- Add EPUB fixtures for cover, images, vertical text, horizontal text, complex spine, and broken resources.
- Expand WebView pagination regression checks.
- Replace brittle source-string tests with behavior tests in areas being refactored; keep source guards only for security, SAF/native/build wiring, or framework constraints that cannot be tested behaviorally.
- Keep release/debug native build behavior stable while architecture refactoring proceeds.

## Persistent Blockers

- Diagonal popup swipe validation is blocked until adb or manual setup can reliably reach a Reader or nested Dictionary popup state suitable for gesture verification.

## Required Validation

Before claiming implementation complete, run:

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Also run `./gradlew lint` when changing resources, manifest, UI, packaging, or release-facing build behavior.

For settings/navigation changes, verify settings controls update immediately and route changes avoid fade transitions on e-ink displays.

For dark-theme cold-start regressions, use emulator screen recording with the App Appearance theme set to Dark and confirm no light `No Books` app frame appears before the bookshelf loads.

For bookshelf tab-switch regressions, use real-device screen recording to confirm cover placeholders do not flash white when returning to Books from the bottom tab bar.

For bookshelf-to-reader regressions, use real-device continuous screenshots or screen recording to confirm no Bookshelf loading spinner or dark-mode white loading frame appears between tapping a book and showing the Reader.

For reader/dictionary/audio user flows, perform targeted emulator or device validation using the test data listed in `AGENTS.md`.
