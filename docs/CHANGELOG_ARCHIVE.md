### Changed

- Allow Sasayaki audiobook playback speed up to 2x.

### Fixed

- Keep continuous-mode reader lookup popups aligned with selected text when reader padding is applied.

## [v0.4.3] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Add an iOS-style reader focus mode that hides reader chrome and the Android status bar while keeping the reading layout stable.

### Changed

- Move the reader Sasayaki play/pause shortcut to the top-right chrome and let its visible state reserve top reader space like iOS.

- Keep Sasayaki previous/next cue controls available from Android system media controls, and make paused cue seeks reveal the correct text without flickering back to the old highlight.
- Make dictionary word audio respect the Background Audio setting, so Interrupt can hand audio focus back afterward while Lower Volume uses Android's best-effort ducking request and Keep Volume keeps background audio playing.
- Let local audio `android.db` imports appear in stricter vendor Android file pickers while still rejecting non-database files after selection.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Keep repeated dictionary reordering aligned with the row being dragged when several dictionaries are installed, and prevent the release animation from snapping back before settling.
- Match the bookshelf cover loading placeholder to the shelf background, preventing white cover flashes when returning to Books from the bottom tab bar in dark mode.
- Wait for saved reader appearance settings and the first bookshelf load before drawing the app shell, avoiding light-theme empty-library flashes during dark-theme cold starts.
- Let the Android launch screen follow the system light or dark mode before the app UI is ready.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Add Android system media controls for Sasayaki audiobook playback, including the current book cover, so play/pause, previous/next cue, and seeking can be controlled from the media controls area while reading.

### Fixed

- Keep the paged reader snapped to full pages while selecting text, so Android WebView selection handles no longer leave vertical text split between page offsets. #43
- Keep Sasayaki cue highlighting aligned after compatibility ideographs such as `猪`, so subsequent audiobook cues no longer drift by one character.
- Keep the reader open when returning from Android system media controls during Sasayaki audiobook playback, preventing overlapping audio from a second app entry.
- Keep the screen awake during Sasayaki audiobook playback only when Auto-Scroll is enabled, matching iOS and restoring normal sleep behavior when playback pauses or Auto-Scroll is off.
- Keep reader Appearance and Sasayaki sheets fixed at half height so their internal settings lists scroll without fighting bottom-sheet expansion gestures, while preserving drag-handle swipe-down dismissal and matching the Appearance handle background to the settings page. #42

- Add fixed Page Up/Page Down reader paging and a Settings -> Behavior page for optional volume-key paging with reversible direction.
- Add lookup popup link redirects with back/forward history, optional popup action bar controls, and a Compact Pitch Accents dictionary setting.

### Fixed

- Reject mismatched import files before reading them, so EPUB, Sasayaki SRT, Sasayaki audiobook, local audio database, dictionary, and reader font imports only accept their supported file extensions.
- Use the same compact Settings detail header for Dictionaries, Appearance, and Advanced so subpage content starts directly below a single top bar.
- Prevent dictionary lookups from starting when tapping links, ruby text, or popup cross-reference links, and align reader WebView text sizing with iOS.
- Keep reader progress and page turns in sync after tapping EPUB internal chapter links from the in-book table of contents. #39
- Keep lookup popup text, tags, and controls readable when E-ink Mode and Dark theme are both enabled. #37

## [v0.1.6] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Add a Settings -> Diagnostics page that shows Android process exit diagnostics, saves them as a `.txt` file, and shares them as text for issue reports.

### Fixed

- Reduce excess top spacing in Books, Settings, and the Advanced settings header so those screens use more visible space near the status bar. #36
- Make Android system Back return from Settings -> Diagnostics to Settings instead of closing the app.
- Render lookup popups in e-ink mode with high-contrast square black/white styling for dictionary tags, frequency labels, and popup controls.
- Fix Dictionary tab lookup results rendering blank after search in v0.1.5 by loading popup CSS and JavaScript from the shared WebView bridge regardless of the result page base URL. #33
- Render SVG dictionary media in lookup popups, restoring icons embedded in structured dictionary definitions. #35
- Fix a crash when opening `また、同じ夢を見ていた.epub` by normalizing EPUB-private CSS before Android WebView renders reader chapters. #34

## [v0.1.5] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Add an Appearance e-ink mode that maps app chrome, reader surfaces, selected controls, and progress indicators to pure black/white colors for e-ink displays.

### Fixed

- Improve reader sheet contrast for e-ink displays: Chapters is opaque, Chapters and Appearance no longer dim the page behind them, and both use a visible top outline boundary.
- Restore readable selected Appearance segmented controls and their Material selected check indicator in e-ink light/dark reader settings.
- Keep dictionary imports from dimming the Dictionaries page while the import spinner is shown.
- Remove the outline from the reader bottom Back/Menu buttons in light and dark themes.
- Reduce extra top and bottom spacing in the reader so page content uses more of the visible reading area. #29
- Prevent the reader from briefly flashing the start of a chapter before restoring the saved reading position. #30
- Delay lookup popup display until its first rendered entry is ready, avoiding a blank white popup flash on slow-refresh e-ink screens.
- Speed up dictionary results and lookup popups by serving shared popup assets from the WebView bridge and fetching entries lazily instead of embedding every entry in the initial HTML.
- Reflow reader pages after device orientation changes so the chapter is rendered for the new screen ratio. #31

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- Redesign the Books, Dictionary, and Settings shell with Material 3 adaptive navigation, responsive bookshelf sizing, and constrained large-screen settings layouts.
- Tighten the Books screen chrome by reducing book title weight, compacting shelf and row spacing, matching the phone bottom navigation surface to the page background with a divider, disabling bookshelf overscroll stretch, and smoothing bookshelf scrolling by caching scaled cover thumbnails and loading reading progress outside each grid item.
- Reduce decorative shadows, elevation, transparency, and reader fade animation across the main shell, dictionary search/popup, reader chrome, and settings groups for lower-power e-ink devices, while keeping low-cost outline borders for visible control boundaries.
- Use full-width Material-style dividers between Settings entries instead of iOS-style inset separators.
- Remove the duplicate large-screen navigation rail inset so tablet and landscape layouts do not waste extra blank space beside the left navigation rail.
- Align the Books shelf content to the start of the large-screen content area instead of centering the constrained grid with a wide empty gutter.

### Fixed

- Fix EPUBs with XHTML self-closing script tags rendering blank in the reader by loading chapter XHTML directly before injecting reader assets, matching iOS image sizing, and skipping blank pages produced by malformed short/image chapters. #24
- Clear reader and nested popup word highlights when dismissing lookup popups, so tapping the same word again opens a fresh popup instead of only clearing stale highlight state. #25
- Replace iOS-only reader font presets with Android Japanese Mincho and Gothic system font presets so switching fonts changes reader rendering. #26
- Keep the reader open when the device display orientation changes, instead of returning to the bookshelf. #27
- Import large local audio databases in the background with progress, require deleting the existing `android.db` before importing another one, and explain the extra free-space requirement for the copied database. #28

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Preserve embedded cover image ratios for Calibre SVG cover wrappers instead of stretching the cover image. #4
- Make Android system Back return from Settings -> Appearance to Settings instead of closing the app. #21
- Let EPUB, dictionary, font, and local audio database imports show Android providers that appear under "Browse files in other apps".
- Make dictionary popup swipe-to-dismiss default on with a lower threshold range, tolerate natural diagonal horizontal swipes, and apply Appearance changes immediately inside an open reader.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Fix the Settings `Report an Issue` link so it opens the Android issue tracker. #2
- Fix dark-mode readability across the app, reader, and settings surfaces. #1
- Fix release APK EPUB import and reader startup failures.
- Keep the Background Audio segmented control evenly sized when labels wrap. #3
- Disable the Android stretch effect when dragging past the edge of the reader or dictionary popups.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Add EPUB import through Android DocumentsUI with multi-book bookshelf storage.
- Add bookshelf covers, title metadata, recent/title sorting, duplicate import handling, progress display, and single-book deletion.
- Add the reader with saved position restore, page and chapter navigation, vertical Japanese text support, cover/image page handling, and reader chrome.

### Changed
