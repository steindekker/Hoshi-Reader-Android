## Current Queue

### 1. Dictionary lookup normalization and query rebuild threading

Status: pending Android sync.

Commits:

- `0d6c072` - bump hoshidicts to `1198201a...`.
- `cfc1e50` - build query off main thread.

Why this precedes popup/Anki payload work:

- Lookup normalization and query rebuild behavior sit below Dictionary search, reader lookup, recursive popup lookup, and Anki mining. Updating this foundation first keeps later popup and template validation tied to the current native matching semantics.

iOS behavior to mirror:

- The hoshidicts revision adds Japanese text processors for NFKC normalization, alphanumeric-to-fullwidth conversion, and kanji variant standardization.
- Lookup query construction runs on a detached user-initiated task with a generation token so stale builds cannot overwrite newer query bundles.
- Lookup and style reads return empty results while no query bundle is ready instead of force-unwrapping a partially rebuilt query.

Android current gap:

- `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge/app/src/main/cpp/hoshidicts` is still at `497578824f...`, while iOS now uses `1198201a...`; Android therefore lacks the new native text processors and their `utf8proc` / kanji-processor dependencies.
- `DictionaryRepository.rebuildLookupQuery()` and `DictionaryLookupQueryService.rebuild()` still run synchronously on the caller's dispatcher. Dictionary mutation callers use IO dispatchers, but the repository/service contract itself does not expose an asynchronous rebuild API.

Suggested slice:

- Update `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` and nested hoshidicts submodules to the new native revision, wiring any new CMake/JNI dependencies without changing Android lookup models unnecessarily.
- Move lookup rebuild ownership to a coroutine/dispatcher-aware service API if rebuild callers need service-enforced IO dispatching after the native revision update.
- Add behavior tests around lookup rebuild ordering and native normalization where feasible; if native fixture coverage is limited, add a small tracked dictionary fixture or construct one in test.

Validation:

- Lookup terms containing half-width/full-width alphanumerics, NFKC-normalizable forms, and kanji variants in Dictionary tab, reader popup, recursive popup, and selected-text overlay.
- Import, enable/disable, reorder, delete, update, and backup-restore dictionaries while search/reader lookup is active; confirm the UI remains responsive and stale rebuilds do not replace newer dictionaries.
- `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew assembleDebug` on a clean native build after submodule updates.

## Covered Or No Android Action

- `36be339`: Android now covers IPA/transcription pitch dictionary display. The hoshidicts Kotlin/JNI bridge exposes `PitchEntry.transcriptions`; lookup popup payloads serialize transcriptions separately from numeric pitch positions; popup JavaScript renders transcription rows without treating them as Japanese pitch accents; transcription text is rendered as supplied by the IPA dictionary; and Anki mining exposes Yomitan-compatible `{phonetic-transcriptions}` HTML.
- `94d0c41`: Android now mirrors dictionary automatic updates. Updatable dictionaries show an Updates section with automatic update controls, Daily/Weekly/Monthly intervals, Last Update/Never display, manual Update, foreground-triggered WorkManager checks constrained to unmetered networks, shared import/update busy state across the Dictionary UI and automatic updates, per-dictionary partial-failure handling, last-update persistence after at least one successful check/import, and staged import replacement that leaves failed dictionaries intact.
- `ab6722e`, `67bdbb9`, `1aaee97`, `c2e1c09`, `32d76d2`: Android now covers the TTU/Google Drive book-data slice. Book folders retain `<folder>.epub` and `BookMetadata.epub`; legacy extracted books are repacked only after parse verification; Books can export stored EPUBs; Backup settings expose TTU bookdata export/import; Google Drive sync lists remote book folders, discovers TTU sidecars, uploads missing bookdata when Upload Books is enabled, imports remote-only books, trashes remote folders, clears cached Drive IDs/covers, and only preflights for an active network with internet capability before Drive REST requests.
- `73a9e62`: Android now mirrors the Dictionary pull-to-clear/show-keyboard slice with reader-style iframe search results, localized pull/release labels, active Dictionary tab refocus/select-all, and measured search-result placement below the search field.
- `a713c0c`: iOS keeps command-center previous/next cue controls wired even when skip controls are enabled. Android already keeps cue navigation available through reader chrome, Sasayaki sheet controls, and media-session previous/next commands.
- `09951b4`, `612d350`, `ad71067`, `4b26d8a`, `172577c`, `be42499`: iOS version/build bumps only.
- `51bd0f2`: iOS compiler setting and ZIPFoundation update. Android uses its own ZIP/Java/Kotlin stack; no direct action.
- `b84bb79`, `adcbc96`, `7b98ec7`: iPad-specific safe-area/layout adjustments. Keep as Android tablet validation context rather than direct sync unless a matching tablet issue appears.
- `f07d8ea`: continuous restore wait-for-viewport workaround was reverted by `9b3e135`; Android should not copy that approach.
- `5518193`: Android already has `readerAlwaysShowProgress` persistence, the Appearance toggle, suppression of normal top/bottom progress bubbles while enabled, and bottom safe-area progress rendering.
- `e70008d`: iOS hoshidicts package revision bump to `497578824f...`; Android's hoshidicts bridge submodule already points at the same native revision.
- `7d49301`, `cce1693`: upstream author confirmed the popup scale, selection-coordinate, and vertical-anchor changes are WebKit-bug-specific and should not be copied to Android.
- `3405d69`: iOS settings UI cleanup and documentation links. No direct Android sync beyond keeping future settings copy localized and Android-specific.
- `147e3b9`: Android already ships default English and Simplified Chinese resources with localization tests. Future queue items that add user-visible strings still need the normal paired `values` / `values-zh-rCN` updates.
- `61306c7`: formatting and whitespace cleanup only.
- `32aa342`: Android now sanitizes Calibre-like EPUB CSS rules in `ReaderResourceSanitizer`, with behavior coverage for writing mode, line height, height, positive text indentation, negative text indentation, non-Calibre rules, and appended default body line height.
- `2ffde40`: iOS changed NWPathMonitor gating to block only explicitly unsatisfied paths. Android Drive requests now only require an active network with `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET`; device-code auth still treats transient network failures as retryable.
- `691baa2`, `323449c`: Android already localizes the Reading shelf title through `BookshelfSectionModel.titleRes = R.string.bookshelf_section_reading`, `BookshelfSectionHeader`, and paired English/Simplified Chinese resources.
- `078d59f`: Android already overrides publisher column counts in paginated mode through `ReaderContentStyles` with `body * { column-count: auto !important; -webkit-column-count: auto !important; }`.
- `1fcf287`: iOS SwiftUI file-importer placement fix. Android backup restore uses dedicated `rememberLauncherForActivityResult(FileImportContent())` launchers for `.hoshi` and TTU `.zip` imports.
- `b1509d9`, `a7a8380`, `55a32cd`, `2b8a599`, `98b6534`: Android reader now matches this slice. `selection.js` keeps SVG containers outside image-hit blocking while preserving SVG `<image>` hits and emits per-character highlight ranges; `ReaderBottomSafeProgress` handles bottom safe-area taps for focus/popup dismissal; `ReaderGeneratedLayout` applies the vertical one-pixel image-width guard; paginated and continuous reader JS remove whitespace-only ruby text nodes and wrap ruby base text before lookup offsets are built.
- `8ef25f4`, `5cbdaa8`, `8ffca61`: Android now covers the Anki template and glossary handlebar slice. `AnkiFieldTemplates` covers exact Lapis, Kiku, and Senren models using Hoshi's Android Lapis handlebar defaults on the corresponding model fields; fetch and note-type selection only autofill when selected-model fields are unmapped; `AnkiHandlebarRenderer` supports brief, no-dictionary, selected fallback, and suffixed single-glossary variants; dictionary-title update migration rewrites the supported per-dictionary variants; and the insertion picker exposes only the iOS-visible variants.
