### Fixed

- Add EPUB folder import from the Books screen, recursively finding books in the selected folder and its subfolders.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Keep bookshelf covers filled and cached when returning to Books, reducing cover flashes and scroll jank.

## [v1.1.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Rework reader lookup popups to render inside the reader WebView through an iframe layer, improving popup dismissal, touch stability, large-result first paint, and selection-highlight reveal timing while preserving E-ink underline marks, recursive lookup, audio, Anki, redirect history, and native-aligned action and Sasayaki controls.
- Support ABI-specific GitHub update APKs while retaining compatibility with the existing arm64 update package during the transition.
- Speed up opening books from the bookshelf by avoiding duplicate EPUB parsing and reusing saved reader character-count sidecars when they still match the EPUB spine.

### Fixed

- Prevent Anki mining from adding book covers or audio media when their corresponding field placeholders are not used.
- Keep fullscreen reader image zoom aligned with the tapped or pinched area, prevent panning beyond the image bounds, and keep image edges visible outside the safe-area-aware top controls.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Add fullscreen reader image viewing with zoom, copy, save, and share controls for large images and SVG illustrations, while keeping Blur Images taps from opening lookup until the image is revealed.
- Add an Advanced reader Layout setting for paragraph spacing, matching iOS vertical and horizontal text spacing behavior.
- Add iOS-aligned immersive reader chrome and focus mode, with floating controls over fullscreen text, transient system bars, focus quick controls, Android Back revealing chrome before closing the reader, and theme/scroll interactions that avoid unnecessary reader reloads.

### Fixed

- Keep status bar icons readable when Android is in system dark mode but the reader uses Light, Sepia Light, or Sepia Dark themes. #73
- Improve reader pagination and continuous layout so vertical text uses page-height columns, and continuous padding restores and displays against the padded viewport.
- Keep recursive lookup popup selection honoring the configured scan length instead of always scanning 16 characters.
