Hoshi Reader Android is a lightweight Japanese EPUB reader app for Android, built for immersion learning with Yomitan lookup, Anki card creation, audiobook read-along, and e-ink mode options.

This project is a native Android recreation of [Hoshi Reader](https://github.com/Manhhao/Hoshi-Reader).

## Download Hoshi Reader Android APK

Download the latest Hoshi Reader Android APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HuangAntimony/Hoshi-Reader-Android/releases/latest).

Hoshi Reader Android requires Android 9 or later.

## Development Status

Feature parity with the iOS app is complete. Current development focuses on polishing UI and user interactions.

See [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for shipped user-visible changes.

## Feature Requests

Please submit general feature requests to the iOS repository first.

If the request is Android-specific, or cannot be implemented on iOS because of system limitations, such as e-ink themes or volume-key page turning, please open an issue in this repository.

## Privacy And Data

Hoshi Reader Android stores imported books, dictionaries, fonts, audiobook data, reading progress, highlights, statistics, and settings locally in app storage.

Google Drive sync uses a user-configured Google Cloud OAuth device-code flow. Anki card mining talks to AnkiDroid or the configured AnkiConnect endpoint. Update checks read GitHub release metadata.
