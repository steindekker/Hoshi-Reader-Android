**Goal:** Refactor VN as a special pagination mode over shared reader-web
semantics, so VN stops carrying parallel text, range, media, ruby, highlight,
and Sasayaki logic that the paginated and continuous modes do not use.

**Architecture:** Shared reader-web modules are only "shared" when at least two
reader modes consume their production API in the same phase, with a path to all
three modes when the behavior is mode-neutral. Mode-specific page metrics,
scrolling, screen boundaries, reveal timing, and bridge navigation remain in
the mode assets. The refactor must remove or replace old mode-local
implementations as shared code is introduced; moving VN-only logic into a new
file is not sufficient.

**Tech Stack:** WebView reader assets in
`app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader`, Kotlin asset injection in
`app/src/main/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/features/reader`, JavaScript unit tests
under `app/src/test/js`, and JVM tests under `app/src/test/java`.

**Current Branch Baseline (2026-06-25):**

- `reader-text-semantics.js` is production-shared by paginated, continuous, and
  VN for text normalization and raw/matchable character semantics.
- `reader-dom-text.js` is production-shared by paginated and continuous for
  live DOM ruby/text normalization. VN keeps its own rendered-screen cloning
  path and is protected by VN furigana preservation tests instead of being
  forced onto live-DOM helpers that do not match its renderer.
- `reader-media-semantics.js` is production-shared by paginated, continuous,
  and VN for image setup, SVG image aspect-ratio handling, blur wrapping, image
  tap bridging, scoped setup, and load/failure waiting where a mode opts in.
- `reader-vn-content-stream.js` and `reader-vn-range-map.js` are explicitly
  VN-specific runtime primitives, not shared reader core.
- `ReaderPaginationScriptsTest` no longer asserts production JavaScript source
  strings. Paginated/continuous restore and progress behavior is covered by
  JavaScript behavior tests that execute the reader assets.

---

## Problem Statement

Android has three WebView-backed reader modes: paginated, continuous, and VN.
VN is not a separate reader engine; it is a paginator with different page
boundaries and optional progressive reveal. The long-term problem is that VN
has accumulated private copies of reader semantics that should be common:

- text normalization and matchable/raw character counting.
- ruby-aware text handling.
- source-to-rendered text offset mapping.
- Sasayaki cue range construction and punctuation inclusion.
- persisted highlight raw range mapping.
- media classification, image setup, and media-stop behavior.
- progress and restore anchors over chapter text.

The refactor target is not satisfied by creating a new file that only VN uses.
That just relocates the separate VN implementation. A shared module must replace
existing mode-local code in at least two production reader modes before it is
accepted as shared reader core.

## Shared-Core Admission Rules

Use these rules before adding, naming, or keeping a shared reader-web module.

- A file named as shared reader core, such as `reader-*-semantics.js`,
  `reader-*-range*.js`, or `reader-*-stream.js`, must have production callers
  from at least two reader modes in the same implementation phase.
- If a module is only consumed by VN, keep it inside
  `reader-visual-novel.js` or name it explicitly as VN-specific until a second
  mode consumes it.
- A sharing phase must delete or replace the old mode-local implementation it
  supersedes. Adding a generic wrapper while the original logic remains the real
  runtime path does not count.
- A shared API should expose mode-neutral operations. It must not know whether
  a caller is paginated, continuous, or VN unless the function name explicitly
  describes a mode adapter.
- Each phase must include characterization tests before behavior is moved and
  parity tests after both consumers are wired.
- Production line growth is a review signal. After any sharing phase, inspect
  `git diff --numstat main...HEAD`; if production additions are more than twice
  production deletions for that phase, either remove the displaced code in the
  same phase or document why the phase is a foundation-only exception.

Useful audit command:

```bash
git diff --numstat main...HEAD | awk '
BEGIN { prod_add=prod_del=test_add=test_del=doc_add=doc_del=0 }
{
  add=$1; del=$2; path=$3;
  if (path ~ /^docs\// || path == "AGENTS.md") { doc_add += add; doc_del += del }
  else if (path ~ /\/src\/test\//) { test_add += add; test_del += del }
  else { prod_add += add; prod_del += del }
}
END {
  printf("production\t%d\t%d\tnet %+d\n", prod_add, prod_del, prod_add-prod_del);
  printf("tests\t%d\t%d\tnet %+d\n", test_add, test_del, test_add-test_del);
  printf("docs\t%d\t%d\tnet %+d\n", doc_add, doc_del, doc_add-doc_del);
}'
```

## Mode Boundaries

These responsibilities should stay mode-specific unless a later design proves a
smaller safe boundary:

- paginated page metrics, columns, page snapping, and page-turn scroll math.
- continuous viewport scrolling and scroll restore.
- VN block/sentence screen boundaries, `sentencesPerScreen`, viewport fitting,
  reveal timers, blank-area advance, and current-screen rendering.
- navigation bridge behavior that converts a mode-local target into a visible
  page, scroll position, or VN screen.

These responsibilities are candidates for shared core because they describe
reader content rather than reader navigation:

- text normalization and character counting.
- DOM walker filtering rules for readable text.
- ruby normalization and ruby-preserving text extraction.
- media classification and image setup primitives.
- Sasayaki cue normalization, cue intersection, and punctuation policy.
- raw and matchable range indexing over rendered text.
- progress target math over semantic character counts.

## Target File Responsibilities

The exact file names may change during implementation, but each shared file must
meet the admission rules above.

- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-text-semantics.js`:
  normalization, raw counting, matchable counting, and matchable character
  checks. Production consumers: paginated, continuous, and VN.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-dom-text.js`:
  readable text walker filters, ruby text normalization, and adjacent text-node
  stabilization when those behaviors are identical. Production consumers:
  paginated and continuous first; VN only where screen rendering needs the same
  DOM operation.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-media-semantics.js`:
  shared image setup primitives, including SVG image setup, large image block
  marking, blur wrappers, and native image tap bridge. Production consumers:
  paginated, continuous, and VN. Deeper media tag classification and
  standalone-versus-inline decisions may move here only when the shared API
  replaces production callers in at least two modes in the same phase.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-rendered-range-index.js`:
  generic raw/matchable range lookup over rendered text. It should accept a
  mode adapter for "which rendered root is visible" and "how source offsets map
  to rendered text". Production consumers: shared Sasayaki/highlight code and
  VN.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-sasayaki-ranges.js`:
  cue normalization, cue intersection, punctuation inclusion, and conversion
  from cue offsets to rendered ranges. Production consumers:
  `reader-sasayaki.js` for paginated/continuous and VN's Sasayaki integration.
- `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-vn-content-stream.js` and
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-vn-range-map.js`:
  VN-specific runtime primitives. They are allowed only when their names and
  callers make the VN ownership explicit; do not describe them as shared reader
  core until a second mode consumes a mode-neutral API with tests.

## Data Flow

The desired final flow is:

```text
chapter DOM
  -> shared content/text/media semantics
  -> shared rendered range indexes
  -> mode-specific paginator or scroller
  -> mode-specific renderer and bridge commands
```

Paginated and continuous should not adopt VN screen descriptors. VN should not
adopt page/scroll runtime state. The shared layer sits below those mechanics and
answers content questions consistently for all modes.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Correct The Current Branch Shape

**Purpose:** Make the branch honest before adding more abstraction. Shared files
that only VN uses must either gain a second production consumer or be renamed as
VN-specific.

**Files:**

- Modify: `docs/VN_READER_PAGINATION_REFACTOR.md`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-text-semantics.js`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-vn-content-stream.js`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-vn-range-map.js`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Inspect: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`

- [x] Run the production/test/doc diff audit command from
  `Shared-Core Admission Rules`.
- [x] List every new shared-looking module and its production consumers:
  paginated, continuous, VN, or none.
- [x] For every VN-only shared-looking module, choose one correction:
  make a second mode consume the mode-neutral part, split the mode-neutral part
  into a smaller shared module, or rename the remaining module as VN-specific.
- [x] Do not proceed to later phases while a VN-only module is documented as
  shared reader core.
- [x] Keep VN-only primitives named as VN-specific modules.

Verification:

```bash
git diff --numstat main...HEAD
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
```

### Phase 1: Make Text Semantics Truly Three-Mode

**Purpose:** Keep the lowest-risk sharing, but make it explicit and complete.
All three modes should call the same production API for text normalization,
raw counting, matchable counting, and matchable character checks.

**Files:**

- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify/Create:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-text-semantics.js`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`
- Modify/Create: `app/src/test/js/reader-text-semantics.test.mjs`

- [x] Add tests that call the shared text API directly for normal text,
  punctuation, whitespace, ruby markup, and gaiji-like inline images.
- [x] Add mode tests proving paginated, continuous, and VN delegate to the same
  API instead of local copies.
- [x] Remove local duplicate text semantic helpers from mode files, keeping only
  thin delegating methods when external bridge code expects those method names.
- [x] Keep page/scroll/screen navigation unchanged.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests moe.antimony.hoshi.features.reader.ReaderPaginationScriptsTest
```

### Phase 2: Share DOM Text And Ruby Normalization Where Behavior Matches

**Purpose:** Extract duplicated paginated/continuous DOM text normalization
first, because those two modes already share the same live-DOM model. VN adopts
only the parts that are identical for rendered screen DOM.

**Files:**

- Modify/Create: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-dom-text.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
  only if the rendered-screen behavior is identical.
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`

- [x] Characterize current paginated and continuous behavior for
  `normalizeRubyTextNodes`, `stabilizeRubyAdjacentTextNodes`, and readable text
  walker filtering.
- [x] Extract the identical implementation into `reader-dom-text.js`.
- [x] Replace paginated and continuous local copies with calls to the shared
  module in the same phase.
- [x] Add VN tests for furigana preservation after render and reveal. VN is not
  wired to the live-DOM helper because its rendered-screen cloning behavior is
  not identical.
- [x] Remove displaced paginated/continuous local implementations.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
git diff --numstat main...HEAD
```

### Phase 3: Share Media Classification And Image Setup

**Purpose:** Remove duplicate image/media setup while preserving mode-specific
navigation. This phase targets the visible bugs around VN consecutive images
without creating a VN-only media module.

**Files:**

- Modify/Create:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-media-semantics.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/features/reader/ReaderPaginationScriptsTest.kt`

- [x] Characterize current paginated/continuous image setup for plain `img`,
  SVG `image`, wrapped images, blur backgrounds, tap handling, and inline gaiji.
- [x] Extract shared image setup behavior into `reader-media-semantics.js`,
  including SVG image handling, large-image block marking, blur wrappers, and
  native image tap bridge.
- [x] Replace paginated, continuous, and VN local image setup code with the
  shared API.
- [x] Keep mode-specific media-stop navigation in each mode.
- [x] Add VN tests for consecutive standalone images and SVG image containers.
- [x] Remove old duplicated local image setup functions.
- [x] Replace former source-string checks for image setup injection with JS
  behavior tests that execute the reader assets.
- [ ] Extract deeper media classification and standalone-versus-inline
  decisions only after the shared API can replace production callers in at
  least two modes in the same phase.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests moe.antimony.hoshi.features.reader.ReaderPaginationScriptsTest
```

### Phase 4: Share Sasayaki Cue Range Semantics

**Purpose:** Make the punctuation and cue-range rules common. The shared layer
should build cue ranges over an abstract rendered text index; it should not know
whether the visible target is a page, a scroll position, or a VN screen.

**Files:**

- Modify/Create:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-sasayaki-ranges.js`
- Modify/Create:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-rendered-range-index.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-sasayaki.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`

- [ ] Characterize existing paginated/continuous Sasayaki highlighting through
  `reader-sasayaki.js`.
- [ ] Characterize VN cue highlighting, including punctuation split across text
  nodes and cue ranges that cross VN screen boundaries.
- [ ] Extract cue normalization, cue start/end handling, intersection, and
  punctuation inclusion into `reader-sasayaki-ranges.js`.
- [ ] Make `reader-sasayaki.js` use the shared cue-range builder.
- [ ] Make VN use the same cue-range builder through its rendered-screen range
  adapter.
- [ ] Remove VN-private cue range collection that duplicates the shared rule.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
```

### Phase 5: Share Raw Highlight Range Mapping

**Purpose:** Persisted highlights use raw chapter offsets. The raw-range lookup
policy should be shared, while each mode still decides how to display or scroll
to the resulting rendered ranges.

**Files:**

- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/highlights.js`
- Modify:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-rendered-range-index.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`

- [ ] Add tests for raw highlight ranges that start/end inside text nodes,
  across sibling text nodes, around ruby markup, and around punctuation.
- [ ] Extract raw-range-to-rendered-range lookup into the shared rendered range
  index.
- [ ] Make existing `highlights.js` use the shared raw range lookup for
  paginated/continuous.
- [ ] Make VN use the same lookup for the currently rendered screen.
- [ ] Remove VN-private raw highlight segment collectors.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
```

### Phase 6: Share Progress Target Helpers, Not Navigation Mechanics

**Purpose:** Share the semantic math for "which chapter character position does
this progress mean" while preserving each mode's own visible landing behavior.

**Files:**

- Modify/Create:
  `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-progress-semantics.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-paginated.test.mjs`
- Modify: `app/src/test/js/reader-visual-novel.test.mjs`

- [x] Add baseline behavior tests for existing paginated/continuous restore and
  progress behavior before extracting the shared helper: paginated
  chapter-start restore, paginated mid-node restore, continuous chapter-start
  restore, continuous exact-end restore, initialization restore ordering after
  image setup, and paginated/continuous matchable progress counting before the
  viewport.
- [ ] Extract only mode-neutral helpers: clamping progress, converting progress
  to target character count, and finding the nearest text position for a target
  count.
- [ ] Keep paginated page snapping, continuous scroll landing, and VN screen
  selection in their existing mode files.
- [ ] Add or keep tests for chapter start, near-zero progress, mid-node
  restore, near-end restore, exact-end restore, and VN screen restore parity
  after the shared helper is introduced.
- [ ] Remove duplicate target-count math where the shared helper replaces it.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
```

### Phase 7: Final Reduction And Documentation Cleanup

**Purpose:** Close the loop by ensuring shared modules are actually shared and
VN no longer carries duplicate implementations for the extracted semantics.

**Files:**

- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-visual-novel.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-paginated.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/assets/hoshi-web/reader/reader-continuous.js`
- Modify: `app/src/main/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/features/reader/ReaderPaginationScripts.kt`
- Modify: `app/src/main/java/moe/antimony/hoshi/features/reader/ReaderWebAssets.kt`
- Modify: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Modify: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md`
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` only if the accepted shared-core rule must become an
  always-loaded repository rule.

- [ ] Run `rg` for removed duplicate function names such as
  `collectSasayakiCueRanges`, `highlightSegmentsForChapterRawRange`,
  `setupReaderImage`, `normalizeRubyTextNodes`, and `stabilizeRubyAdjacentTextNodes`.
- [ ] For each remaining mode-local implementation, classify it as
  mode-specific navigation/rendering or move it into shared core.
- [ ] Run the production/test/doc diff audit and check that production growth is
  explained by real new behavior or offset by deletion of displaced code.
- [ ] Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` only for current architecture facts that are
  true after the implementation.
- [ ] Remove completed future-target text from
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md` or rewrite it to describe only remaining
  durable gaps.
- [ ] Do not add a changelog entry for pure refactor work. Add one only for
  user-visible fixes that ship as behavior changes.

Verification:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
./gradlew test
./gradlew assembleDebug
git diff --check
git status --short
```

## Testing Strategy

Prefer behavior tests over source-string assertions.

- Shared modules get direct `node --test` coverage with DOM fixtures created in
  the test file.
- Every shared module must have at least one test proving two production modes
  consume the same API.
- VN tests must cover furigana preservation, reveal behavior, consecutive media
  screens, Sasayaki punctuation, cross-screen cues, raw highlights, lookup
  ranges, fragment restore, and progress restore.
- Paginated/continuous tests must cover parity for any helper they adopt.
- Kotlin tests must not assert production JavaScript source text. Keep them to
  typed command serialization, layout calculations, WebView result parsing, and
  other Kotlin-side API behavior. Asset injection and reader runtime behavior
  should be protected by executing the JavaScript assets in JS tests or, where
  necessary, WebView instrumentation tests.

Required commands before claiming the refactor complete:

```bash
node --test app/src/test/js/*.test.mjs
./gradlew test
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Manual validation is required for user-visible reader behavior after runtime
migration slices. Follow `docs/VALIDATION.md` and cover paginated, continuous,
and VN modes in vertical and horizontal writing; VN block and sentence screens;
reveal speed 0/45/120; blank-area click advance; lookup taps; links; images;
restore; chapter boundaries; and Sasayaki cue behavior.

## Exit Criteria

The refactor is complete only when all of these are true:

- Every shared reader-web module has production consumers from at least two
  modes; mode-neutral modules have consumers from all three modes.
- VN no longer has private copies of text semantics, ruby/text normalization
  that matches other modes, media classification/image setup, Sasayaki cue range
  policy, raw highlight range mapping, or progress target math.
- Paginated and continuous keep their page/scroll navigation behavior, but they
  consume shared content semantics where the behavior is mode-neutral.
- VN keeps only genuine VN responsibilities: block/sentence pagination,
  viewport fitting, reveal, screen rendering, and screen-based navigation.
- The final production diff shows displaced mode-local code being removed, not
  only new abstraction being added.
- Automated tests and required Gradle commands pass.
- Architecture docs describe the final current state without completed phase
  history or temporary handoff notes.
