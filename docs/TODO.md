# Hoshi Android Roadmap

> Status values: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
> After every implemented feature, update this file before committing so development can resume from the current state.

## Execution Rules

- iOS is the only source of truth for user-visible UI and interaction behavior.
- If Android behavior differs from iOS, inspect the iOS implementation first and remove the difference instead of adding isolated compatibility patches.
- Use `testdata/test.epub` and `testdata/test2.epub` for EPUB reader validation and `testdata/JMdict_english.zip` for Yomitan dictionary validation.
- Each implemented feature must be verified in an Android emulator before commit.
- Each implemented feature commit must include the matching status update in this file.
- If a feature is blocked, mark it as `blocked`, record the blocker, and continue with the next feasible item.

## Roadmap

1. `done` - Stabilize EPUB reading main flow
   - Save and restore reader position using the iOS `bookmark.json` shape.
   - Preserve iOS WebView paging semantics: page scroll first, chapter transition only at boundaries.
   - Keep reverse chapter transitions landing at the previous chapter end.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub`: saved `chapterIndex=9`, `progress=0.2734952481520591`, relaunched app, reopened reader, restored to `item/xhtml/p-003.xhtml` with `scrollTop=1668` and matching progress.

2. `in_progress` - Bookshelf and book metadata
   - `done` - Move from a single `current.epub` directory to multi-book storage.
   - `done` - Persist title, cover path, folder, and last access in iOS-shaped `metadata.json`.
   - `done` - Open imported/listed books from their independent storage directories.
   - `done` - Render cover thumbnails in the bookshelf.
   - `done` - Align basic bookshelf sorting with iOS `Recent` / `Title`.
   - `done` - Align single-book delete flow with iOS long-press context action plus confirmation.
   - `todo` - Align multi-select, shelves, and batch actions with iOS.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub`: cleared app data, imported the EPUB twice through DocumentsUI, confirmed two shelf rows and two independent `files/Books/<uuid>/metadata.json` files, then opened a listed book into the reader.
   - Verified cover thumbnails on emulator with `testdata/test.epub`: imported through DocumentsUI, confirmed `metadata.cover` is `item/image/cover.jpg`, and visually checked the real cover image renders in the shelf row.
   - Verified sorting/deletion on emulator: opened sort menu, switched from `Recent` to `Title`, long-pressed a book row, used `Delete`, confirmed the dialog, and checked `files/Books` metadata count decreased.

3. `in_progress` - Reader settings
   - `done` - Implement iOS-aligned reader Appearance sheet entry from the reader.
   - `done` - Apply theme, text orientation, font size, horizontal padding, vertical padding, and line height through WebView CSS without changing reader page-turn logic.
   - `done` - Persist reader Appearance settings across app restart.
   - `todo` - Align font family selection/import with iOS `FontManager`.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub`: opened reader, opened Appearance from the reader, changed font size from 22 to 23 and theme to Dark, confirmed WebView computed CSS changed to `fontSize=23px`, black background, white text, and confirmed those settings persisted after force-stopping and reopening the app.

4. `done` - WebView selection bridge
   - `done` - Implement JS-side text selection, selected text extraction, range data, and popup anchor rectangles.
   - `done` - Keep native Android as the receiver of JS results instead of reimplementing DOM logic.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub`: imported through DocumentsUI, opened a vertical text chapter in WebView, confirmed `window.hoshiSelection` and `HoshiTextSelection` are injected, performed a real tap on正文 text, and observed JS selection data returning selected text `見です` with sentence `「そこまでは俺も同意見です。`.

5. `in_progress` - Dictionary lookup popup
   - `done` - Connect lookup to `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge`.
   - `done` - Trigger lookup from WebView selection results.
   - `done` - Add first-pass popup positioning using iOS `PopupLayout` geometry.
   - `done` - Close lookup popup from the same Reader-level tap-outside and page-turn paths as iOS, and add popup-level horizontal swipe dismissal for gestures that start on the popup itself.
   - `done` - Replace raw Compose glossary text with a popup WebView renderer that expands Yomitan structured-content JSON into HTML without adding search or other extra capabilities.
   - `todo` - Align popup rendering with iOS `PopupWebView` for dictionary CSS, media, nested lookups, audio controls, and Anki mining.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub` and imported `testdata/JMdict_english.zip`: opened a vertical text chapter, tapped `お冷や`, and confirmed a popup appears over the reader with `お冷や`, reading `おひや`, and JMdict glossary content.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub` and imported `testdata/JMdict_english.zip`: tapped `お冷や`, confirmed the popup reading `ひや` appears, then confirmed popup-level horizontal swipe, tap outside the popup, and Reader page swipe each dismiss the popup without leaving the reading node visible.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/test.epub` and imported `testdata/JMdict_english.zip`: tapped `お冷や`, inspected the popup WebView through Chrome DevTools Protocol, and confirmed it renders `冷や`, `ひや`, `cold water`, and `JMdict [2026-04-27]` as HTML while no longer showing raw `structured-content` JSON; also rechecked popup WebView horizontal swipe dismissal.

6. `in_progress` - Dictionary import and management
   - `done` - Build Android native `hoshidicts_jni` from `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` while linking to `third_party/hoshidicts-gplv3`.
   - `done` - Import `testdata/JMdict_english.zip` through the GPLv3 `hoshidicts` bridge.
   - `done` - Persist iOS-shaped `Dictionaries/config.json` and list imported term dictionaries.
   - `todo` - Align enable/disable, delete, type picker, reordering, and import state with iOS `DictionaryView`.
   - Do not reimplement Yomitan import or dictionary media handling outside the bridge.
   - Verified on emulator with `testdata/JMdict_english.zip`: imported through DocumentsUI, confirmed dictionary list shows `JMdict [2026-04-27]`, confirmed private files `Dictionaries/Term/JMdict [2026-04-27]/index.json`, `blobs.bin`, `hash.table`, and `Dictionaries/config.json`, and temporarily verified native lookup query returned `猫` for lookup text `猫` before removing the debug UI.

7. `todo` - Highlights and notes foundation
   - Store highlight anchors based on WebView range data.
   - Restore highlights after chapter load through JS.
   - Align highlight tap, delete, and color behavior with iOS.

8. `todo` - Anki integration
   - Investigate AnkiDroid APIs before implementation.
   - Build the smallest card creation flow from dictionary lookup results.
   - Do not copy iOS AnkiMobile x-callback behavior directly.

9. `todo` - Audio and pronunciation
   - Play dictionary audio with AndroidX Media3/ExoPlayer.
   - Read dictionary media through the existing dictionary bridge.
   - Align playback triggers and UI with iOS.

10. `todo` - Sync
    - Investigate Android Google Drive/OAuth integration.
    - Sync sidecar JSON, progress, settings, and dictionary configuration.
    - Do not reuse iOS token or keychain assumptions.

11. `todo` - Regression coverage and release hardening
    - Add EPUB fixtures for cover, images, vertical text, horizontal text, complex spine, and broken resources.
    - Expand WebView pagination regression checks.
    - Keep Gradle `test`, `assembleDebug`, and `lint` passing before release-facing changes.
