# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Hoshi Reader Android are documented here.
The format follows a Keep a Changelog style, and release sections use Semantic Versioning.
Historical release notes before v1.3.0 live in [CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md](CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add Show, Blur, and Hide privacy modes for bookshelf covers, plus deterministic
  title and author artwork when a book has no visible cover.
- Warn users before enabling AnkiConnect that most setups can create cards
  directly through AnkiDroid and that an incorrect AnkiConnect configuration
  prevents fetching decks and note types or creating cards.
- Add term dictionary categories with category-aware Anki definition mappings
  and iOS-aligned advanced category/fallback controls, Kanji dictionary
  import/management and popup lookup, a verified one-tap
  stroke-order font download for Kanji users, plus complete pitch data with H/L
  patterns and nasal/devoice markers.
- Add downloadable recommended Japanese font families to Reader Appearance,
  including separate family and named variant selectors, real static and
  variable weight selection, verified app-private downloads, and family/variant
  grouping for imported TTF and OTF fonts, with compact one-level type grouping
  in the font menu.
- Add an optional Reader Behavior setting that uses the volume keys to jump
  between terms in the topmost lookup popup.
- Add `hoshi://search?text=...` deep links for opening lookup results in the
  existing popup overlay, with `mode=app` support for opening the Dictionary
  tab instead.

### Fixed

- Ask for confirmation before resetting Dictionary custom CSS to prevent
  accidental clearing.
- Keep text and images reachable in every Reader mode when publisher CSS wraps
  paragraphs or empty layout struts in oversized inline blocks.
- Restore book files and covers from iOS Books backups when equivalent Unicode
  paths use different composed forms.
- Match Sasayaki subtitles immediately after selecting an SRT, including unique
  cues immediately before the stable starting sequence, combined-volume EPUBs,
  and large text gaps, without requiring Search Window tuning or a separate
  Match action.
- Import EPUB and TTU bookdata with multibyte titles that exceed Android's
  filename byte limit while preserving the complete visible title and cleaning
  temporary EPUB data after failed imports.
- Keep wide inline gaiji at the publisher's text-relative size, recognize any
  publisher class containing `gaiji`, and render gaiji plus transparent
  monochrome images embedded in text with the active Reader text color while
  blending away their image backgrounds in standard and custom themes and
  excluding gaiji from image navigation.
- Use EPUB fallback text for failed inline gaiji images, while retaining a
  broken-image marker and its inline space when no fallback text is available.
- Open EPUB pages that use paired XHTML viewport metadata instead of remaining
  on the Reader loading screen.
- Keep oversized lookup popup frames fully inside the visible screen so their
  bottom border and all scrollable content remain reachable.
- Keep the Dictionary type selector's `Frequency` label on one line on compact
  screens.
- Prefer Arial throughout lookup popups before Android's Japanese font fallback
  so pitch-accent markers stay aligned with their reading, and keep pitch
  dictionary labels intact when compact entries wrap.

## [v1.3.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Automatically center the current chapter when opening the Reader Contents or
  Sasayaki chapter list.
- Add per-source enable controls for imported local audio databases while
  preserving each source's configured priority.
- Add Ogg Opus audiobook import with embedded title, artist, cover, and chapter
  metadata in Sasayaki, load its artist without the platform-reader delay, and
  show MP3, M4B, and Opus audiobook duration before playback starts.
- Add a Reader Appearance swipe-threshold control for paginated and VN modes;
  setting it to zero disables swipe page turns while preserving hardware page
  keys.
- Add up to three named Anki card formats with independent icons, decks, note
  types, field mappings, tags, and duplicate states.
- Add confirmation before deleting Anki formats and an edit-screen action that
  duplicates a format and returns to the format list.
- Add Anki duplicate-note search buttons that appear only for matching notes,
  plus grouped per-format mining and search actions placed before audio.
- Add precise cloze-part handlebars, numeric pitch accent graph handlebars, and
  advanced glossary mapping options for Anki cards.

### Changed

- Increase the default lookup popup size to 500 × 500 dp and allow its
  height to be adjusted up to 1000 dp.
- Align the built-in Lapis, Kiku, and Senren field presets with iOS by no longer
  setting sentence-card marker fields.

### Fixed

- Allow importing supported files whose display names contain `#` or `?`,
  including EPUB volume numbers such as `Book #01.epub`.
- Base reduced-motion popup scrolling on the portion of the popup that is
  actually visible when its configured height exceeds the screen.
- Show Reader Contents, fragment jumps, and chapter labels for EPUBs whose
  navigation document is stored in a subdirectory.
- Prevent staggered multi-touch taps in paginated and VN Reader modes from
  being mistaken for a page-turn swipe.
- Keep Google Drive sync and TTU backup restore compatible with progress files
  whose book data IDs exceed Android's 32-bit integer range.
- Keep dictionary lookup available when tapping Sasayaki-highlighted text in VN
  Reader mode.

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add the option to create a new shelf while moving one or more selected books.
- Add a Reader image gallery, true table-of-contents chapter ranges, and optional
  current-chapter progress in Reader chrome and statistics.
- Add a configurable daily statistics reset time and pause reading statistics
  while Reader sheets or fullscreen images are open.
- Add optional current-book cover publishing for the Android lock screen and a
  fixed PNG file used by compatible E-ink sleep-screen tools, plus direct
  integration with iReader’s built-in Book Cover screen saver on compatible
  domestic and Musnap overseas firmware using standard PNG output, with Fit,
  Fill, and Stretch scaling modes.

### Changed

- Expand Sasayaki delay adjustment to -4...4 seconds and playback speed to
  0.5...3x.
- Rename the Reader Go to panel to Contents, order its tabs as Chapters,
  Highlights, Gallery, and Search, and remove overscroll deformation from
  scrolling surfaces throughout the app.

### Fixed

- Keep Reader progress, search, and Sasayaki character offsets stable around
  numeric HTML entities, and keep lookup sentence expansion and recursive
  expression-tag scanning within the selected text boundary.
- Keep manual bookshelf sync from rebuilding the entire shelf, while refreshing
  imported reading progress in place.
- Keep large bookshelves smooth during repeated scrolling by reusing
  size-appropriate persistent cover thumbnails instead of decoding original
  covers again after they leave memory, while recovering from transient
  generation failures or damaged thumbnail-cache entries without hiding valid
  covers.
- Remember the selected Contents and Sasayaki tabs for the current Reader
  session, and keep Sasayaki on the current tab after importing an audiobook.
- Keep VN lookups and mined Anki sentences complete when a word or sentence
  continues onto a later screen.
- Keep Anki audio, book covers, Sasayaki clips, and dictionary media from
  overwriting different exported media by using content-specific filenames.
- Keep dictionary definitions in the configured dictionary order when an
  inflected lookup merges multiple deinflection candidates.
- Keep Sasayaki jumps to cues in the previous chapter from counting the target
  chapter in the current reading session when image holding is enabled.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Add a Reader Appearance setting for top safe area height.

### Changed

- Improve dictionary lookup and import behavior by honoring Yomitan term scores
  and normalizing Japanese iteration marks, full-width numbers, and emphatic
  sequences.
- Raise Statistics daily goal limits to 200,000 characters and 12 hours.

### Fixed

- Keep the Statistics tab visible after enabling it and switching away from Settings.
- Refresh Statistics by-book covers when changing calendar ranges.
- Keep Reader lookup highlights from expanding to an entire ruby annotation when
  selecting a shorter word inside it.
- Keep VN vertical text from jumping to a new column immediately after a ruby
  annotation.
- Keep long-pressed Reader volume keys paging or seeking Sasayaki instead of
  falling back to system volume changes after the first press.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Add a full-library Statistics tab with habit summaries, calendar range browsing, per-book distribution, daily and weekly goals, and an Advanced Statistics visibility switch.

### Changed

- Open the Reader Go to panel on Chapters by default, order its tabs as Chapters, Highlights, and Search, and focus the search field when Search is selected.

### Fixed

- Prefer exact expression-and-reading local audio matches before falling back to reading-only or expression-only entries.
- Read Sasayaki M4B title, author, and cover metadata from MP4 atoms when Android's platform metadata reader returns empty.
- Improve VN reader media screens, first-highlight display, vertical layout, punctuation wrapping, and lookup and Sasayaki highlight alignment.
- Keep VN and continuous vertical reader content aligned to the configured vertical padding instead of the bottom overlap area.
- Prevent reader lookups from crashing on words that begin with supplementary-plane kanji such as 𠮟.
- Keep Sasayaki image hold active while viewing fullscreen Reader images, and avoid repeated holds once the continuous Reader target image is already visible.

## [v1.3.0-fork] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Add a "Mine with options" button to each dictionary entry — next to the existing one-tap "Add to Anki" — that opens a sheet to adjust a card before adding it. Available wherever lookups appear: the Dictionary tab, the in-book reader, and process-text lookup. One-tap "Add to Anki" is unchanged.
- In that sheet, choose the card's Sentence from a list of Massif example sentences for the word, instead of the default in-book context line.
- In that sheet, choose the card's Picture: none, the book cover (the default in the reader), or an image from a Bing search of the word shown as a thumbnail grid. The choice fills the Picture field through a single `{image}` marker (replacing the separate book-cover and web-image markers). Map Picture to `{image}` under Settings → Anki.
