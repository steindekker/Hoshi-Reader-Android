# Hoshi Android Agent TODO

Last updated: 2026-05-11

This file is the short operational handoff for future agents.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file under 150 lines.
- Record only current state, next actionable work, active blockers, and durable validation requirements.
- Do not paste long emulator transcripts, adb details, screenshot observations, release notes, or per-commit history here.
- Put user-visible shipped changes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep architecture-refactor slice state out of tracked docs; use the local `.codex/skills/hoshi-refactoring-workflow` skill when available.
- Put detailed reproduction, verification logs, and investigation notes in the relevant issue, PR, commit message, or a focused doc.
- When completing a task, update the smallest relevant line here in the same commit.

## Open Alignment Work

### Architecture And Hardening

- Make screen-level Compose Flow collection lifecycle-aware with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` where the UI lifecycle is the right owner.
- Continue Reader state/WebView bridge extraction in behavior-protected slices from `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTORING.md`; keep `ReaderWebView` focused on composition and wiring.
- Replace remaining brittle source-string tests in touched areas with behavior, API, state-flow, or structured-config coverage where possible.
- Add EPUB/WebView regression fixtures for cover pages, multi-image pages, vertical text, horizontal text, complex spines, and broken resources.
- Add repeatable benchmark or baseline-profile entry points for cold start, EPUB import/open reader, reader page turn, dictionary search, and lookup popup open.

### Bookshelf, Import, And Backup

- Device-validate shelf-name entry and multi-EPUB DocumentsUI import in a session where text input and picker interaction can be driven reliably.
- Cross-validate Android-created `Books` and `Dictionaries` `.hoshi` archives restored by iOS.

### Reader And Lookup

- Finish remaining iOS `PopupWebView` Anki mining behavior beyond selected popup text export.
- Validate paginated and continuous reader modes together for cover image pages, multi-image illustration pages, long text paging, forward and backward chapter boundaries, reverse cross-chapter landing, lookup popup open, and bookmark restore.
- Re-check forward chapter-boundary landings at chapter start, visual-state-gated chapter jumps, and stable progress counters during rapid boundary flips.
- Re-run diagonal popup swipe validation once a Reader or nested Dictionary popup state is reliably reachable.
- Future reader fixes must start from `reference/Hoshi-Reader-iOS/Features/Reader/ReaderWebView/ReaderWebView.swift` plus the matching JS/CSS, and must keep WebView-based reading and lookup.

### Dictionary

- Align recommended dictionary download/update behavior with iOS `DictionaryView`, including recommended downloads, update availability, and revision-based update flow.
- Keep frequency and pitch dictionaries type-specific; do not treat metadata dictionaries as term fallback dictionaries.
- Do not reimplement Yomitan import, lookup, media, or style extraction outside `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge` unless the bridge gap is documented first.

### Highlights And Notes

- Store highlight anchors from WebView range data.
- Restore highlights after chapter load through JS.
- Align highlight tap, delete, and color behavior with iOS.

### Anki

- Add Android AnkiConnect parity behind the existing Anki backend boundary: connection, fetch, duplicate checks, media storage, add-note, and optional force-sync behavior.
- Expand backend coverage for duplicate checks and the future AnkiConnect implementation.
- Keep popup mining decoupled from direct HTTP calls; route backend differences through the Anki backend boundary.

### Sync

- Implement Android Google Sign-In/OAuth/Drive API integration.
- Match iOS upstream sync behavior by creating the root `ttu-reader-data` Drive folder when needed.
- Sync the iOS-supported per-book data: bookmark/progress, statistics, and Sasayaki audiobook state.
- Support iOS-style manual sync direction, auto sync, statistics sync mode, and Sasayaki sync toggles.
- Do not reuse iOS token/keychain assumptions.

### Release Distribution

- Before F-Droid distribution, split update behavior by distribution channel so F-Droid builds do not bypass F-Droid update checks.

## Required Validation

Before claiming implementation complete, run:

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Also run `./gradlew lint` when changing resources, manifest, UI, packaging, or release-facing build behavior.

For settings/navigation changes, verify settings controls update immediately and route changes avoid fade transitions on e-ink displays.

For dark-theme cold-start regressions, use emulator screen recording with the App Appearance theme set to Dark and confirm no light `No Books` app frame appears before the bookshelf loads.

For bookshelf tab-switch regressions, use real-device screen recording to confirm cover placeholders do not flash white when returning to Books from the bottom tab bar.

For bookshelf-to-reader regressions, use real-device continuous screenshots or screen recording to confirm no Bookshelf loading spinner or dark-mode white loading frame appears between tapping a book and showing the Reader.

For reader/dictionary/audio user flows, perform targeted emulator or device validation using the test data listed in `AGENTS.md`.
