# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Hoshi Reader Android are documented here.
The format follows a Keep a Changelog style, and release sections use Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Reduce extra top and bottom spacing in the reader so page content uses more of the visible reading area. #29

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- Redesign the Books, Dictionary, and Settings shell with Material 3 adaptive navigation, responsive bookshelf sizing, and constrained large-screen settings layouts.
- Tighten the Books screen chrome by reducing book title weight, compacting shelf and row spacing, matching the phone bottom navigation surface to the page background with a divider, disabling bookshelf overscroll stretch, and smoothing bookshelf scrolling by caching scaled cover thumbnails and loading reading progress outside each grid item.
- Reduce decorative shadows, elevation, transparency, and reader fade animation across the main shell, dictionary search/popup, reader chrome, and settings groups for lower-power e-ink devices, while keeping low-cost outline borders for visible control boundaries.
- Use full-width Material-style dividers between Settings entries instead of iOS-style inset separators.
- Remove the duplicate large-screen navigation rail inset so tablet and landscape layouts do not waste extra blank space beside the left navigation rail.
- Align the Books shelf content to the start of the large-screen content area instead of centering the constrained grid with a wide empty gutter.

### Fixed

- Fix EPUBs with XHTML self-closing script tags rendering blank in the reader by loading chapter XHTML directly before injecting reader assets, matching iOS image sizing, and skipping blank pages produced by malformed short/image chapters. #24
- Clear reader and nested popup word highlights when dismissing lookup popups, so tapping the same word again opens a fresh popup instead of only clearing stale highlight state. #25
- Replace iOS-only reader font presets with Android Japanese Mincho and Gothic system font presets so switching fonts changes reader rendering. #26
- Keep the reader open when the device display orientation changes, instead of returning to the bookshelf. #27
- Import large local audio databases in the background with progress, require deleting the existing `android.db` before importing another one, and explain the extra free-space requirement for the copied database. #28

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Preserve embedded cover image ratios for Calibre SVG cover wrappers instead of stretching the cover image. #4
- Make Android system Back return from Settings -> Appearance to Settings instead of closing the app. #21
- Let EPUB, dictionary, font, and local audio database imports show Android providers that appear under "Browse files in other apps".
- Make dictionary popup swipe-to-dismiss default on with a lower threshold range, tolerate natural diagonal horizontal swipes, and apply Appearance changes immediately inside an open reader.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Fix the Settings `Report an Issue` link so it opens the Android issue tracker. #2
- Fix dark-mode readability across the app, reader, and settings surfaces. #1
- Fix release APK EPUB import and reader startup failures.
- Keep the Background Audio segmented control evenly sized when labels wrap. #3
- Disable the Android stretch effect when dragging past the edge of the reader or dictionary popups.
